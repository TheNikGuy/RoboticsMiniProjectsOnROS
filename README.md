# Robotics Mini-Projects on ROS

This repository consist of three projects:

1. RobotTrajectory: A ROS package that automatically generate point-to-point cubic trajectories connecting pairs of randomly generated points.
2. MovingPandaOnRVIZ: A ROS package that will automatically generate Cartesian space movements of the end-effector of the Panda robot manipulator: the end-effector will "draw" squares of different sizes on the x-y Cartesian plane, starting from a given robot configuration.
3. RobotExpressionUsingBBN: A ROS package that simulates a simple computational model of social human-robot interaction.
